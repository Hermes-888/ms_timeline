FINDINGS:
Cervical:
* Alignment: Normal.
* Vertebrae and Marrow: Normal vertebral body height. Normal
marrow signal.
* Disc spaces: Mild disc desiccation and loss of height most
notable at C5-C6 and C6-C7.
* Cervical Cord: There are multiple patchy ill-defined foci of
T2 signal hyperintensity which are best appreciated on axial T2
sequence of the cervical spine. Patchy lesions in the left
lateral cord at the level of C2, left lateral cord at the level
of C3, right dorsolateral cord at the level of C4, posterior
cortical level of C4-C5, left lateral cord at the level of
C5-C6, right lateral cord at the level of C7. There is no
associated enhancement.
* Soft tissues: Unremarkable.

* C2-3: No significant spinal canal stenosis or neural
foraminal narrowing.
* C3-4: No significant spinal canal stenosis or neural
foraminal narrowing.
* C4-5: No significant spinal canal stenosis or neural
foraminal narrowing.
* C5-6: Minimal posterior disc osteophyte complex which
slightly effaces ventral CSF space. No significant spinal canal
stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.

* C6-7: Small posterior disc osteophyte complex in combination
with uncovertebral hypertrophy results in effacement of ventral
CSF space without flattening cord. There is moderate right and
severe left neural foraminal narrowing.

* C7-T1: Trace disc bulge with no significant resulting spinal
canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.

Thoracic:
* Alignment: Normal.
* Vertebrae and Marrow: Normal vertebral body height.
Subcentimeter T1 and T2 hyperintense focus in the posterior T11
vertebral body most consistent with small fatty hemangioma.
* Disc spaces: Mild disc desiccation in the mid to lower
thoracic spine, most notable at T10-T11, T11-T12, T12-L1.
Minimal disc protrusion at the level of T3-T4 and T7-T8 with no
significant resulting spinal canal stenosis.

* Thoracic Cord: There are multiple ill-defined T2 hyperintense
lesions in the thoracic cord, most notably in the left
dorsolateral cord at the level of T3 and central cord at the
level of T5.
* Soft tissues: Unremarkable.

* Enhancement: No abnormal enhancement following contrast
administration.



IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple small ill-defined cord lesions, predominating in
the white matter tracts of the cervical cord which are
suspicious for demyelinating disease.

2. No enhancing lesions.

3. Combination of posterior disc osteophyte complex and
uncovertebral hypertrophy results in partial effacement of the
ventral CSF space at C6-C7 with moderate right and severe left
neural foraminal narrowing.
